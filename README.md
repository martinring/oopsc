oopsc
=====

This is a compiler for the OOPS programming language written in [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org).

The OOPS programming lanugage is a fictional language introduced in the course ["Übersetzer" (Compiler)](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agbkb/lehre/uebersetzer/) at the Universität Bremen. At the beginning of each course a java based compiler is provided which has to be extended with several features. This project offers an alternate functional compiler base written in scala which has no more than the same features as the provided java compiler.
